#Create a Dockerfile file
FROM <name_of_image>
COPY <source> <destination>

(e.g. If using nginx, nginx's default site location)
COPY <source_path> /usr/share/nginx/html

#Expose ports (if not specified TCP is used)
#EXPOSE 80 (mainly used as documentation)

#CMD entry points. Adds commands that nginx image passes in when started by default 
(e.g. CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"])


#Create .dockerignore file
enter **/<file_name> into file

docker run -d -p 80:80 <image_id> <container_name>

docker ps 

#exec into a container (alpine e.g.)
docker exec -it <image_id> /bin/sh
